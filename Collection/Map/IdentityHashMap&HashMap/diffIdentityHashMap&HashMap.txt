/*Difference between IdentityHashMap and HashMap
Difference between IdentityHashmap vs HashMap in Java Interview question
Though both HashMap and IdentityHashMap implements Map interface, have fail-fast Iterator and non synchronized collections, following are some key differences between HashMap and IdentityHashMap in Java.

1) Main difference between HashMap vs IdentityHashMap is that IdentityHashMap uses equality operator "=" for comparing keys and values inside Map while HashMap uses equals method for comparing keys and values.

2) Unlike HashMap, who uses hashcode to find bucket location, IdentityHashMap also doesn't use hashCode () instead it uses System. identityHashCode (object) .

3) Another key difference between IdentityHashMap and HashMap in Java is Speed. Since IdentityHashMap doesn't use equals() its comparatively faster than HashMap for object with expensive equals() and hashCode().

4) One more difference between HashMap and IdentityHashMap is Immutability of key. One of the basic requirement to safely store Objects in HashMap is keys needs to be immutable, IdentityHashMap doesn't require keys to be immutable as it is not relied on equals and-hashCode.
