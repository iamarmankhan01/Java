Casting in Java:-
Converting a particular data type into required datatype is called 
type casting.

********************************
What is class upcasting?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
we store child class object address into parent class reference variable, so that reference variable becomes re-usable

Example: Reusing reference variable

public class A {
	
}

public class B extends A{

}

public class C extends A{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		A a1 = new B();
		System.out.println(a1);
		a1 = new C();
		System.out.println(a1);
	}
}


***************************
What is class downcasting?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
-> Here we store parent class object address into child class reference variable.
-> To perform downcasting, firstly do upcasting and then perform downcasting.
Example:
---------
public class A {
	
}
public class B extends A{
	
}
public class C extends A{
	 
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		A a1 = new B();
		if(a1 instanceof B) {
			B b1 = (B)a1;
			System.out.println("Downcasting successful!");
		}
	}
}
